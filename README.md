# Why?
Marketing Segmentation enables a business to understand its ideal customers and tailor products to meet the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer groups. This approach allows for more efficient marketing, focusing efforts on segments most likely to purchase a product, rather than marketing to all customers indiscriminately.

## Goal
Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.
