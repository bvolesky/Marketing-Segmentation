# Why?
Marketing Segmentation enables a business to understand its ideal customers and tailor products to meet the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer groups. This approach allows for more efficient marketing, focusing efforts on segments most likely to purchase a product, rather than marketing to all customers indiscriminately.

## Goal
Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.

## Learnings
In this project, I significantly expanded my data science skills by effectively combining various techniques to extract meaningful insights. A crucial lesson was the importance of clean, well-structured data, as it is foundational for accurate analysis. Ensuring the data is in the correct format, with sensible naming and thorough validation, is essential to avoid problems in subsequent processes.

I also gained proficiency in feature engineering, learning to create new variables for correlation analysis and plotting. Understanding the impact of outliers on results and mastering data preprocessing methods like labeling, scaling, and dimensionality reduction further enhanced my analytical abilities.

A key discovery was the use of clustering, specifically employing the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and grouping similar data points. This approach was instrumental in segment profiling, revealing distinct patterns based on income and spending habits. By labeling these clusters accurately, I could assess their significance and the effectiveness of targeted marketing campaigns.

The project culminated in combining age and generational data to understand each cluster's behavior and preferences, including family composition and comparative analysis. This experience was incredibly valuable, and I'm eager to apply these data science techniques in future endeavors.
